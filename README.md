A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++.

Started back in 2009, later moved to Github from Bitbucket.

The implementation borrowed a few ideas from the Tic-Tac-Toe game in chapter
9 of "Invent Your Own Comptuer Games with Python, 2nd Edition"
http://inventwithpython.com/chapter9.html
In particular, the notSoStupidMove is entirely based on the AI of that game.
